/**
 * @brief PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Controller implementation.
 *
 * This class implements a discrete PID controller that can be used for feedback
 * control systems. The controller calculates an output based on the error
 * between a target state and current state using proportional, integral, and
 * derivative terms.
 *
 * The controller equation is: output = Kp*error + Ki*âˆ‘error + Kd*(error -
 * prev_error)
